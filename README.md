# Advanced_ML_DL_Course_Assignment_1
**By: Raz Graider, Sophie Margolis and Dana Braynin**

In this project, we focused on analyzing information about bicycle rentals from a company's records during the years 2011 to 2013. 
We were given 8,164 samples and explored 12 features within our dataset, aiming to identify patterns and relationships using various techniques from statistics and machine learning with the goal of developing a strong predictor. 
Our project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation with respect to the RMSE score.
We were asked to develop 3 models that predict how many bicycles were rented in each day and compare their performance. 
Ultimately, we achieved a test RMSE score of 40.617 using the 'XGBoost Regressor' model.

**This project was done as an assignment in the Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning course at Tel Aviv University.**
